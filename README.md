# lra-benchmark

This repository is based on Long Range Arena (LRA) datasets from Google Research. Another repo provided by Google is available [here](https://github.com/google-research/long-range-arena).
In this repo we allow researchers try out some simple tasks, and has the advantage of using PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers instead of Jax/Flax, with which less are familiar.

## Use Benchmark
1. Run `sh ./get_data.sh`
2. [TBD]

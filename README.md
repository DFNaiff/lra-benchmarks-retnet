# lra-benchmark

This repository is based on Long Range Arena (LRA) dataset from Google Research. It is a lean wrapper for some tasks in the original repo and has the advantage of using PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers instead of JAX/Flax, with which less are familiar.

## Use Benchmark
1. Run `sh ./get_data.sh`
2. [TBD]
